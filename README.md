This project is a browser-based app that renders glowing orbs with colors that are created dynamically and change with every visit to the site.

Version 0: The amount of orbs is dynamic and can change with every visit to the site.

Version 1: The orbs fade in and out of view. The amount of orbs and their colors change every time they reappear.

Version 2: The orbs will appear at randomized locations with every render.
